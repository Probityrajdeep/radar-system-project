🚀 Project Overview
This project consists of the following components:

ESP32: Hosts the web server and controls the servo motor.
ESP8266: Connects to the Wi-Fi network and also controls the servo motor.
Servo Motor: Rotates to scan the area.
Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects objects in the scanning area.
Web Interface: Displays the radar data.
🛠️ Components
ESP32
ESP8266
Servo Motor
Ultrasonic Sensor
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
240 Ohm Resistor
📑 Code Structure
The code for this project is divided into two main parts:

ESP32
The ESP32 is responsible for:

Hosting the web server.
Displaying the radar data.
Controlling the servo motor.
ESP8266
The ESP8266 is responsible for:

Connecting to the Wi-Fi network.
Controlling the servo motor.
📷 Schematic
Here's a diagram to help you set up the components correctly:


🚀 How to Use
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Probityrajdeep/radar-system-project.git
📁 This will download the project files to your local machine.

Open the Code:
Open the code in your preferred IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE). 🖥️

Configure Wi-Fi Credentials:
In both ESP32 and ESP8266 code files, replace your_SSID and your_PASSWORD with your Wi-Fi network credentials. 🌐

Upload the Code:
Upload the respective code files to the ESP32 and ESP8266. 📲

Assemble the Components:
Connect the components as per the schematic. Make sure everything is securely connected. 🔧

Power Up the Devices:
Plug in your ESP32 and ESP8266 to your power source. 🔋

Access the Web Interface:
Find the IP address of the ESP32 from the serial monitor, then open this IP address in your web browser to access the radar interface. 🌍

🌐 Web Interface
The web interface allows you to view the radar data and control the servo motor. Here's an example of what it looks like:


Features:
Real-Time Data: View real-time radar data and object detection.
Control Servo Motor: Set the angle of the servo motor directly from the web interface.
Interactive Buttons: Use buttons to quickly set predefined angles.
🔧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

Check Connections: Ensure all hardware connections are secure and correct.
Verify Wi-Fi Credentials: Double-check the SSID and password in the code.
Monitor Serial Output: Use the serial monitor to view error messages and debug information.
Restart Devices: Sometimes a simple restart can resolve connectivity issues.
Consult the Community: Feel free to open an issue on this GitHub repository for help from the community.
